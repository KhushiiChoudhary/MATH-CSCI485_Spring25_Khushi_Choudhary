# Wine Quality Dataset Analysis  
```markdown


## 📖 Overview  
This project analyzes the **Wine Quality dataset** from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** using **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** and **t-SNE**. The goal is to explore dimensionality reduction techniques and compare their effectiveness in clustering wine quality levels.  

## 🔧 Requirements  
Ensure the following Python libraries are installed:  

- `pandas`  
- `numpy`  
- `scikit-learn`  
- `matplotlib`  
- `seaborn`  

Install missing libraries using:  
```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```

## How to Use the Code  

### Download the Dataset  
✔️ The code retrieves the dataset from the **UCI Machine Learning Repository** automatically.  
✔️ You can choose to analyze **red wine**, **white wine**, or **combine both**.  

### Run the Code in Jupyter Notebook  
1. Open **Jupyter Notebook**.  
2. Run the provided script **cell by cell**.  
3. The script will **load the dataset, check for missing values, and normalize the features**.  

### Apply PCA for Dimensionality Reduction  
1. The code **reduces the dataset dimensions** to two principal components (**PC1 and PC2**).
2. A **scatter plot** is generated to visualize PCA results, color-coded by wine quality.
3. The **explained variance ratio** is printed to indicate how much variance each component captures.  

### Compare with t-SNE Visualization  
1. The script applies **t-SNE** for dimensionality reduction.
2. A **scatter plot** is created to compare **clustering patterns of PCA vs. t-SNE**.  

### Interpret the Results  
1. The output plots help **visualize how PCA and t-SNE capture different patterns** in the data.
2. You can compare their performance and decide **which technique is more suitable for further analysis**.  

## Key Takeaways  
1. **PCA** is useful for **feature reduction**, preserves **global structure**, and provides **interpretability** through explained variance.
2. **t-SNE** is better for **visualization and clustering**, as it captures **nonlinear relationships effectively**.
3. **Trade-offs:** PCA is computationally efficient but may not capture complex structures, while t-SNE is better at separating clusters but requires tuning hyperparameters.  

## Conclusion  
This project provides insights into the differences between **PCA and t-SNE**, helping to choose the best **dimensionality reduction technique** based on the problem at hand.  

## Notes  
- The script should be executed in **Jupyter Notebook** or a **Python environment** with the required libraries installed.  
- If any library is missing, install it using:  
  ```bash
  pip install <library-name>
  ```  
- Modify parameters (e.g., **number of PCA components** or **t-SNE settings**) to experiment with different configurations.
